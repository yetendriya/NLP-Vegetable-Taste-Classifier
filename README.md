# Python

The provided code performs text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

**Import Libraries:**
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy for numerical operations.
nltk for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
sklearn for machine learning algorithms and tools.
collections for creating a defaultdict.

**Read Data:**
Reads a CSV file named "flavors.csv" using pandas. The data is presumably related to flavors and vegetables.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Converts the 'celery' column to lowercase.
Tokenizes the text into words.
Performs part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization.
Removes stopwords and non-alphabetic words.
Stores the preprocessed words in the 'celery_final' column of the DataFrame.

**Train-Test Split:**
Splits the preprocessed data into training and testing sets using a 70-30 split ratio.

**Feature Extraction:**
Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text data into numerical feature vectors. This step is crucial for machine learning algorithms to process text data.
Limits the number of features to 5000.

**Label Encoding**:
Encodes the target variable ('vegetable') using LabelEncoder, converting categorical labels into numerical values.

**Naive Bayes Classification:**
Uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier from scikit-learn to train the model on the TF-IDF transformed training data.
Makes predictions on the test data and calculates the accuracy score.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification:**
Uses the SVM classifier from scikit-learn with a linear kernel to train the model on the TF-IDF transformed training data.
Makes predictions on the test data and calculates the accuracy score.


Overall, the code demonstrates a basic text classification task where the goal is to classify vegetables based on their associated flavors using natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes and SVM).
